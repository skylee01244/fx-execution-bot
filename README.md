# fx-execution-bot

A Python-based trading bot that interacts with the Saxo Bank OpenAPI to fetch live FX spot prices, monitor account balances, manage positions, and place orders. 
This project started as a way to explore automated trading and API-based execution in FX markets. Over time, I plan to expand it into a framework that supports strategy backtesting, risk management, and automated execution.
